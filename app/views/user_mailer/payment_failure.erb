There was a problem taking payment for <%= @organisation.name %>
in Simply Agile.

We tried to take a payment of <%= @organisation.payment_plan.price %>GBP
using the card **** **** **** <%= @payment_method.last_four_digits %>.

We will continue to try to take the payment until <%= @organisation.suspension_date.to_s(:default) %>.
If no payment has been taken by this date then the organisation will be
suspended.

If you wish to change the payment details for this organisation, please
visit the account section at http://besimplyagile.com/ or contact
support@besimplyagile.com.

Regards.
The Simply Agile Team
