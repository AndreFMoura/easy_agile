Jandacap
========

Common capistrano recipes for jandaweb projects.


Example
=======

config/deploy.rb need only specify the application name:

	set :application, "app name"

Then create config/deploy/development.rb and add:

	set :deploy_to, "/rails/APP_NAME.dev.jandaweb.com"

	set :domain, "dev.jandaweb.com"
	server domain, :app, :web
	role :db, domain, :primary => true

Obviously replacing APP_NAME. Do something similar for 
config/deploy/production.rb, setting the deploy_to and domain appropriately.
